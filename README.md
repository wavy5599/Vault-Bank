# Vaultbank — Fintech Dashboard UI (Initial Frontend)

Vaultbank is an **initial frontend build** of a modern fintech dashboard.  
This phase focuses on **layout, visual hierarchy, responsiveness, and UI polish**, establishing a strong foundation before backend logic and real data integration.

## ✨ Focus of This Build

This project was intentionally scoped to the frontend to reflect how real products are built.

Key focus areas:
- Clean, scalable layout systems (grid + flex)
- Advanced CSS styling (blur, gradients, transitions)
- Responsive behavior across screen sizes
- Debugging Typescript UI issues (overflow, stacking contexts, clipping)
- Production-style component structure

No mock APIs or fake logic — this phase is about **getting the UI right first**.
